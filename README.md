# Apex Proxy

Apex unit tests - they're a fact of life for Salesforce developers. But have you been writing them wrong all this time?

If your unit tests are writing and reading from the database, chances are what you're really writing are _integration tests_. The proxy pattern allows you to optimize your unit tests for performance, stability, and isolation.
